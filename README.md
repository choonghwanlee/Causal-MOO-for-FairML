# Causal-MOO-for-FairML
Multi-Objective Optimization for Fair Machine Learning systems, as part of Duke's CompSci590 (Causal Analysis of Algorithms: Fairness & Explainability) final project.

Explored use of multi-objective optimization that combine standard loss functions with fairness objectives.
